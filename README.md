# Grid Graph 

2D square grid graph written in Java. 

Two separate modes are provided:

1. Demo Mode : User places two endpoints and optionally as many walls as possible with the mouse.  
The shortest path is determined by the `edu.princeton.cs.algs4` graph api.
2. Game Mode : Player is must place two endpoints, in a starting grid with random walls. The shortest path,   
if it exists, is traveled and the path taken is converted to walls.
Try to cover as many squares as possible. 
The endpoints must be placed far enough apart, about 5 squares, and in different quadrants of the grid.

## Dependencies

- `edu.princeton.cs.algs4` lib
- optionally Java23
